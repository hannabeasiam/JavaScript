```
Using jQuery, create a web page that contains a form and below the form a <div> containing a small image and text of your choice. In the form, create an Effect field that contains the following radio buttons: Show, Hide, Toggle, Fade In, Fade Out, Fade To, Slide Down, Slide Up, Slide Toggle. Add an Apply button to the form that when clicked, performs the selected jQuery animation on the <div> tag. E.g. If Show is selected, the <div> is shown or if Hide is selected, the <div> is hidden.
