    <h3>What is Software Development Life Cycle?</h3>
   
    <p id="firstP">SDLC is a process followed for a software project, within a software organization. 
      It consists of a detailed plan describing how to develop, maintain, replace and alter or enhance 
      specific software. The life cycle defines a methodology for improving the quality of software and the 
      overall development process.</p>
    <p id="secondP">Stage 1: Planning and Requirement Analysis<br /><br />Planning for the quality assurance requirements and identification of the risks associated with the project is also done in the planning stage. The outcome of the technical feasibility study is to define the various technical approaches that can be followed to implement the project successfully with minimum risks.</p>
    <p class="middleP">Stage 2: Defining Requirements<br /><br />Once the requirement analysis is done the next step is to clearly define and document the product requirements and get them approved from the customer or the market analysts. This is done through an SRS (Software Requirement Specification) document which consists of all the product requirements to be designed and developed during the project life cycle.</p>
    <p class="middleP">Stage 3: Designing the Product Architecture<br /><br />DDS - Design Document Specification is reviewed by all the important stakeholders and based on various parameters as risk assessment, product robustness, design modularity, budget and time constraints, the best design approach is selected for the product.</p>
    <p>Stage 4: Building or Developing the Product<br />Stage 5: Testing the Product</p>
